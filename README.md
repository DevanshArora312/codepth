I have created a Fintech based application that tracks your transaction and balance amount in the app itself, it uses MongoDB to store transaction and user data. 
It also shows the bitcoin/other crypto saved which can be obtained by connecting with crypto-trading profiles(not implemented yet). 
Due to college and less experience with react-native (I have worked with React.js) , I was unable to implement some frontend and login features but I have created the backend for tracking all transactions.

### Installation 

Simply clone the repository and run the following commands -
`cd codepth`
```
cd Client
npm i
```
`cd ..`
```
cd Server
npm i
```

The `env` file for the backend will be just including link to your local Mongo database as DB_URL. 
There is no live deploymment as of yet, will pe updating the repository soon.
